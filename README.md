# Scalable-Event-Driven-Food-Ordering-App-with-Kafka-Python
A highly scalable backend system for a food ordering app. The system is event driven. Every important thing is an event, such as an order being placed and an order being confirmed.   These events are written to Apache Kafka which is a central bus for all moving data.
